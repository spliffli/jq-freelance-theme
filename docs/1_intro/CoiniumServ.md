# Intro

Hello Mani,

Last week I told you I'd get back to you about your private mining pool project on [freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/projects/bitcoin/Create-private-pool-for-etherium/details) and be able to provide more insight than I could at the time.

In these docs, I will cover what I think are the two best available options which you can choose from, [CoinumServ](https://github.com/bonesoul/CoiniumServ) and [NOMP (Node Open Mining Portal)](https://github.com/idigger/ric-nomp).

I mentioned CoiniumServ in my proposal, and I still believe that is a decent option to go for. However, I would actually recommend   NOMP instead of that for a few reasons:

1. It has more security features, and features in general
2. Usability is easier
3. Well documented
4. Built for scalability
